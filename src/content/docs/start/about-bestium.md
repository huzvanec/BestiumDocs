Bestium is a powerful plugin library for [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/) that lets you create **custom entities with unique behavior** without extending vanilla Minecraft classes.
What makes Bestium unique is that instead of working around Mojang's internal restrictions, Bestium injects your entity logic directly into the runtime.

## Features
- [x] Full control over entity behavior
- [x] Entity persistence across server restarts and chunk unloads
- [x] Biome datapack support (you can spawn your entities the vanilla way)
- [x] /summon command support (without tab completion)
- [x] Mob spawn egg support
- [ ] Mob spawner support
- [ ] Summon command with tab completion
- [ ] In-game GUI
